\section{Introduction}

new technical systems with new functionality require willingness of user to cooperate with the system and use it the

way it is designed to be used

explanation of companion systems

goal of companion systems

why this work is useful

transparency of system increases productivity

\section{Trust}

explain trust

why important for human-computer-interface?

why trust is important

user does not need knowledge about concepts used by the technical system, but about the process that leads to the decision or action of the technical system

show and explain hierarchical model of trust (with 6 sub-groups)

\section{Countering Trust Issues}

done with explanations here

used at corresponding issues

explain match of which explanation helps against which trust issue

\section{Explanations}

explain explanation

\subsection{Selecting Explanations}

problem of selecting appropriate type of explanation

types of explanation can follow several or only one goal of explanation

strategies for selecting appropriate explanation

???

\subsection{Where to Use Explanations}

events that start the process of providing explanations

done with knowledge base

comparison of user knowledge base with conceptual knowledge required

various aspects of knowledge graphs used

decay over time, etc...

\section{Architecture}

modular

show / explain graph

using inter-system api modules can interact with each other

each module works completely autark from others, only respond to events (like “need explanation”)

[show path of explanation through system as summary?]

\section{Conclusion}

affirm decision of why explanations are required and useful

handling of trust issues needs to be refined

important(?): explanations can be adapted by any module in the system to fit the need
